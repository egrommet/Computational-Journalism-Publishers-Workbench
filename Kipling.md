# I Keep Six Honest Serving Men
I keep six honest serving-men<br>
(They taught me all I knew);<br>
Their names are What and Why and When<br>
And How and Where and Who.<br>

## The Rest of the Story
_(Did you know there was more?)_

I send them over land and sea,<br>
I send them east and west;<br>
But after they have worked for me,<br>
***I*** give them all a rest.<br>

***I*** let them rest from nine till five,<br>
For I am busy then,<br>
As well as breakfast, lunch, and tea,<br>
For they are hungry men;<br>

But different folk have different views:<br>
I know a person small -<br>
She keeps ten million serving-men,<br>
Who get no rest at all!<br>

She sends 'em abroad on her own affairs,<br>
From the second she opens her eyes -<br>
One million Hows, two million Wheres,<br>
And seven million Whys!<br>
