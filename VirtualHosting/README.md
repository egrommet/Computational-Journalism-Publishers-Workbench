# Virtual Hosting

## Usage
You may have to change some BIOS settings to get the kernel virtual machine hypervisor to work, and some less-expensive PCs may not have support for it in the chips. But most 64-bit Windows PCs have this capability built in.

1. Open a terminal and type

	```
	./install-virtual-hosting.bash
	```
1. On Linux Mint 14, you will be asked to add users to the 'libvirtd' group. This doesn't happen on Fedora 18.
1. [Open an issue on Github](https://github.com/znmeb/Computational-Journalism-Publishers-Workbench/issues/new) if you have any questions or problems.
