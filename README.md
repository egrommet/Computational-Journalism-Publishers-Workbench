## I Keep Six Honest Serving Men
I keep six honest serving-men  
(They taught me all I knew);   
Their names are What and Why and When  
And How and Where and Who.

## Why?
Independent journalists today work in a world dominated by two trends:
* Real-time many-to-many communications platforms, and
* Large sets of complex data with stories waiting to be told.

### Real-time Many-to-Many Communications Platforms
* Hundreds of millions of Facebook and Twitter accounts almost everywhere in the world
* Millions of active Twitter users
* Complex patterns of interactions around people, places and events
* Intricate and changing connection patterns between people
* ***People break and discuss the news in real time on Twitter.***

### Large Sets of Complex Data with Stories Waiting to be Told
* Government data - national, regional, and local
* Business and financial data
* Political fundraising and vote tabulation data
* Environmental and climate data
* Social network data
* And yes - traffic and sports data too

## What's In The Workbench?
* ***100 percent open source technologies!***
* A complete Linux workstation, plus
* Real-time Twitter data collection via REST, Search and User Streams APIs
* Tools for collecting, managing, analyzing and presenting data

    – Numerical
    – Financial and economic
    – Geospatial / mapping
    – Twitter and other text data
    – Social networks and graphs

* Tools for creating, editing and producing digital media

## Who Is It For?
* Journalism students
    – High school, community college and beyond
* Freelance journalists
    – Researchers
    – Reporters
    – Editors
    – Publishers

## Why 100 Percent Open Source?

* Open source software is robust.
* Open source software is low cost.

### Robustness
The components of the Computational Journalism Publishers Workbench are proven technologies in wide use. 
* Tools are crafted by highly-motivated self-regulated communities of experts.
* Security flaws, functionality defects and performance issues are rapidly found and fixed.
* Peer review process yields software that is usually more efficient than commercial counterparts.

### Low Cost
* The software in the Computational Journalism Publishers Workbench is freely downloadable without legal restrictions.
* A wide range of documentation and training material for the tools is available for free on the World-Wide Web.
* ***Functionality that would cost thousands of dollars in commercial licenses is available for the cost of a download!***

### The Rest of the Story
Did you know there was more?

I send them over land and sea,  
I send them east and west;   
But after they have worked for me,  
***I*** give them all a rest.  

***I*** let them rest from nine till five,  
For I am busy then,   
As well as breakfast, lunch, and tea,  
For they are hungry men;   

But different folk have different views:  
I know a person small -   
She keeps ten million serving-men,  
Who get no rest at all!   

She sends 'em abroad on her own affairs.  
From the second she opens her eyes -   
One million Hows, two million Wheres,  
And seven million Whys!

$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout gh-pages
```

If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.

### Designer Templates
We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.

### Rather Drive Stick?
If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.

### Authors and Contributors
You can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.
