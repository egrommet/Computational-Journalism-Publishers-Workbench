* Hundreds of millions of Facebook and Twitter accounts almost everywhere in the world
* Millions of active Twitter users
* Complex patterns of interactions around people, places and events
* Intricate and changing connection patterns between people
* ***People break and discuss the news in real time on Twitter.***
