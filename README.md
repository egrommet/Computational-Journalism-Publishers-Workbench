## I Keep Six Honest Serving Men
I keep six honest serving-men<br>
(They taught me all I knew);<br>
Their names are What and Why and When<br>
And How and Where and Who.<br>
[(RudyardKipling, from "The Elephant's Child" in Just So Stories).](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?SixHonestServingMen)

## Why?

### Independent journalists today work in a world dominated by two trends:
* Large sets of complex data with stories waiting to be told, and
* Real-time many-to-many communications platforms

### Large sets of complex data with stories waiting to be told
* Government data - national, regional, and local
* Business and financial data
* Political fundraising and vote tabulation data
* Environmental and climate data
* Social network data
* And yes - traffic and sports data too

### Real-time many-to-many communications platforms
* Hundreds of millions of Facebook and Twitter accounts almost everywhere in the world
* Millions of active Twitter users
* Complex patterns of interactions around people, places and events
* Intricate and changing connection patterns between people
* ***People break and discuss the news in real time on Twitter.***

## What's in the workbench?

### ***100 percent open source technologies!***
* A complete Linux workstation, plus
* [Redis 2.6](http://redis.io), plus

### Tools for collecting, managing, analyzing and presenting data
* Numerical
* Financial and economic
* Geospatial / mapping
* Text data
* Social networks and graphs
* PDF data extraction tools
* ***Web page, PDF and eBook creation tools***

## Who is it for?
* Journalism students: high school, community college and beyond
* Independent journalists: researchers, reporters, editors, publishers

## Why 100 percent open source?
* Open source software is robust.
* Open source software is low cost.

### Robustness
The components of the Computational Journalism Publishers Workbench are proven technologies in wide use. 
* Tools are crafted by highly-motivated self-regulated communities of experts.
* Security flaws, functionality defects and performance issues are rapidly found and fixed.
* Peer review process yields software that is usually more efficient than commercial counterparts.

### Low cost
* The software in the Computational Journalism Publishers Workbench is freely downloadable without legal restrictions.
* A wide range of documentation and training material for the tools is available for free on the World-Wide Web.
* ***Functionality that would cost thousands of dollars in commercial licenses is available for the cost of a download!***

## I Keep Six Honest Serving Men
I keep six honest serving-men<br>
(They taught me all I knew);<br>
Their names are What and Why and When<br>
And How and Where and Who.<br>

### The Rest of the Story
(Did you know there was more?)

I send them over land and sea,<br>
I send them east and west;<br>
But after they have worked for me,<br>
***I*** give them all a rest.<br>

***I*** let them rest from nine till five,<br>
For I am busy then,<br>
As well as breakfast, lunch, and tea,<br>
For they are hungry men;<br>

But different folk have different views:<br>
I know a person small -<br>
She keeps ten million serving-men,<br>
Who get no rest at all!<br>

She sends 'em abroad on her own affairs,<br>
From the second she opens her eyes -<br>
One million Hows, two million Wheres,<br>
And seven million Whys!<br>
