# [Riak](http://docs.basho.com/riak/1.3.0/)

## Usage

1. Open a terminal and type

	```
	./install-all.bash
	```
1. This takes a very long time on slower machines. Riak requires an older version of Erlang than the one shipped in most current Linux distributions, which means it has to be compiled from source.
1. [Open an issue on Github](https://github.com/znmeb/Computational-Journalism-Publishers-Workbench/issues/new) if you have any questions or problems.
