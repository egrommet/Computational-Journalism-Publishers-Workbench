## Road Map

1. Now that this release is done, I'll be revising the CompJournoStick code to draw from this repository in constructing media. That way, the bill of materials for the stick will be the same as the Fedora version of this workbench.
1. I'm backing the [For Journalism](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gotoplanb/for-journalism) project on Kickstarter. I'm tracking their materials and will be adding software to this project and CompJournoStick to run all of their code.
1. I've looked at openSUSE 12.3 and there are some critical tools missing from their repositories. So I will not be supporting openSUSE going forward.
1. I'm planning to support Ubuntu 13.04 and Linux Mint 15. I don't have enough disk space on my test machines to test Ubuntu on bare metal, however.
1. The next release will have Redis back in. I pulled it mostly because the Linux repositories are still shipping 2.4, and I wanted to pull it from Linux rather than build it from source.
1. The next release will have Shiny server and Node.js. It may also have Meteor, which seems to be the up-and-coming wrapper for Node.js.
