Description : Redis is an advanced key-value store. It is similar to memcached
            : but the data set is not volatile, and values can be strings,
            : exactly like in memcached, but also lists, sets, and ordered sets.
            : All this data types can be manipulated with atomic operations to
            : push/pop elements, add/remove elements, perform server side union,
            : intersection, difference between sets, and so forth. Redis
            : supports different kind of sorting abilities.
