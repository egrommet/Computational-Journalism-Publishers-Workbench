# R GUIs

## Usage

1. Open a terminal and type

	./install-all.bash

2. When the run completes, examine file 'packages.log' for errors. There should be no messages of the form 'ERROR:'. 'warnings' should be 'NULL'. [Open an issue on Github](https://github.com/znmeb/Computational-Journalism-Publishers-Workbench/issues/new) if you have any questions or problems.

3. Note that although only R Commander and Rattle are explicitly installed, JGR and Deducer will be installed as well.
