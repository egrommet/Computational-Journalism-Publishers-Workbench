# [CRAN Task View: Time Series Analysis](http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/TimeSeries.html)

## Usage:

1. Open a terminal and type

	```
	./install-all.bash
	```
1. When the run completes, examine file 'packages.log' for errors. There should be no messages of the form 'ERROR:' and 'warnings' should be 'NULL'. Note: on Fedora systems, there is a missing dependency that causes a few packages to fail. This is a [known bug](https://github.com/znmeb/Computational-Journalism-Publishers-Workbench/issues/183), and I am exploring fixes for it. This should ***not*** happen on Linux Mint or Ubuntu.
1. [Open an issue on Github](https://github.com/znmeb/Computational-Journalism-Publishers-Workbench/issues/new) if you have any questions or problems.
